#go-transip-dyndns

Is a small little executable that will update a domain record of your choice that is hosted by [TransIP](https://www.transip.nl/). Run it via cron to keep your DNS record up to date.

## Setup
1. Make sure you have a domain at Transip
2. Create a access key for the API. `(Control panel > My Account > API)`
3. Add a label and press create.
4. Save Key to a file. `e.g. privatekey.pem`
5. Create config file. [Example config file](#example-config-file)
6. Add it to the crontab `0 * * * *  /usr/local/bin/go-transip-dyndns`
7. run `go-transip-dyndns create` to create the record
8. run `go-transip-dyndns validate` to see if all is üëç
9. You are set. Well done!


## Example config file
name: go-transip-dyndns.toml

place the config file at /etc/go-transip-dyndns.toml or in the directory where you execute the command.

```
username = "transip-username"
private-key = "/path-to/private.key"

verbose = false

domain = "yourdomain.nl"
domain-entry = "subdomain"
domain-ttl = 60
```
